# Online Collisions

Ever wondered how it would feel if multiplayer had collisions? Now you know!

Collisions are entirely client side, so players who don't have the mod won't experience your collisions! They'll be solid walls that don't even react to you.
It is highly recommend you hold grip at the start of each level!
Also I have not seen how this mod acts when multiple people are using it. Hopefully it's okay.

When you have collisions toggled on you will disable leaderboard uploads no matter if you are online or offline!

# Important!

Online Collisions are now included in the Online Additions mod. This mod now serves the purpose of basically being the debug version of online collisions. 
For example, I had attempted to write some code that should reveal what the collision hitbox looks like. It kinda works, but the hitbox doesn't render on the where the actual car is.
This mod may also be used for testing out how different collision boxes feel. I may replace the current Mesh Colliders on the car to a box one for example. All stable code can be brought over to the Online Additions mod if applicable.
