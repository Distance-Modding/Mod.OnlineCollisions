# Online Collisions

Ever wondered how it would feel if multiplayer had collisions? Now you know!

Collisions are entirely client side, so players who don't have the mod won't experience your collisions! They'll be solid walls that don't even react to you.
It is highly recommend you hold grip at the start of each level!
Also I have not seen how this mod acts when multiple people are using it. Hopefully it's okay.

When you have collisions toggled on you will disable leaderboard uploads no matter if you are online or offline!
